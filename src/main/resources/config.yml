# A vacuum hopper will make all items within 5 blocks teleport to the hopper.
# A vacuum hopper can be made by placing a purple carpet on top of a hopper.
# It will be broken when the carpet or hopper is broken.
# Technical Details:
#     The vacuum hopper collects items every 20 ticks (1 second)
#     It just places the items on top of the hopper, so the hopper speed is still important to keep in mind.

# Radius for the vacuum hopper (chunks or blocks decided by `radius-is-chunks`)
vacuum-radius: 5

# If the vacuum-radius should be counted as chunks or blocks
# Notes:
#     If set to true, all entities in the chunk will be teleported (from the bottom of the world to the top)
#     The radius is counted from the current chunks, so the width of the square area is 2n + 1 where n is the radius provided above
#     A radius of 0 makes it a 1x1 chunk area
